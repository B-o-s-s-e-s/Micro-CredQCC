  <p> Hi. Lovely Luna. My name is Pika. I am QC computer science major student. My goal is to become a manager in FANG companies. I am taking this microcredential, because I want learn more about coding and meet more interesting people. Something makes me feel unexpected about this class is .....too fun to be a cs class. It is funest journal I have after quarantine. First time, I am so exciting to take online class. First, I feel time pass so fast during online class. You make online class like "In person" trip. I love it!!!!  </p>
